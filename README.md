# Hello, World!

**Note:** I'm going to Toronto for a few days tomorrow, so I won't be active on GitHub.

I felt that Minecraft datapacks weren't very fun to make, and the format led
to an unnecessary amount of files for related things. The whole "required to
make a new file for every function" thing isn't something that I've seen in
any other language, so I thought I'd try to fix that as well as add some other
features that I thought would be useful.

I hadn't actually made a datapack before building this project, and it was
also my first time doing anything related to parsing text. I also definitely
made the first few releases far earlier than I should've, leading to some
buggy and/or incomplete releases. Despite that, after a bunch of bug fixes and
features, I think I've made something that datapack developers could find
useful.
