# Hello, World!

I accidentally found out that you could make a README for your GitHub profile,
so that's what I did.

## About me

My name is Adam, and I've been writing code since I was about seven years old.
I'd like to think that I've improved since then :)\
Right now, I'm mostly using Rust for backend/standalone stuff and React with
TypeScript for frontend stuff.

## About my projects

### [Databind](github.com/MysteryBlokHed/databind)

I felt that Minecraft datapacks weren't very fun to make, and the format
led to an unnecessary amount of files for related things. The whole "required
to make a new file for every function" thing isn't something that I've seen in
any other language, so I thought I'd try to fix that as well as add some other
features that I thought would be nice.

I hadn't actually made a datapack before building this project, and it was also
my first time doing anything related to parsing text. In spite of that, after
about 150 commits, I think I made something that people could enjoy using.
