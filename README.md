## About my projects

### [Databind](https://github.com/MysteryBlokHed/databind)

I felt that Minecraft datapacks weren't very fun to make, and the format led
to an unnecessary amount of files for related things. The whole "required to
make a new file for every function" thing isn't something that I've seen in
any other language, so I thought I'd try to fix that as well as add some other
features that I thought would be useful.

I hadn't actually made a datapack before building this project, and it was
also my first time doing anything related to parsing text. I also definitely
made the first few releases far earlier than I should've, leading to some
buggy and/or incomplete releases. Despite that, after a bunch of bug fixes and
features, I think I've made something that datapack developers could find
useful.

### [CyberPatriot](https://github.com/MysteryBlokHed/CyberPatriot)

This repository has scripts and checklists for [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org),
a computer defense competiton for middle/high school.
During the first couple rounds of the competition, I noticed a few actions
that had to be done (i.e. checking certain Group Policy options or enabling automatic updates)
that were the exact same process every time.
Because of that, I wrote a few scripts and shared them with the other teams
at my school to make it easier for them.
I guess that publicly sharing tools to help in a competition
might not be the best play, but...here we are.

While writing these, I learned a decent amount about Bash and PowerShell,
which should help me build any similar scripts in the future.

It's also probably not a bad thing to have in my portfolio,
since it shows a decent understanding of Bash and PowerShell
and has commit dates to go along with it.
